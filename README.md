### ðŸ’¡ Description

`udpchat` is a simple command-line application that helps peers connect via UDP using NAT traversal.

It works by:

1. Connecting to a [STUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) server to determine your **public IP and port**.
2. Prompting you to **share this address** with your peer.
3. Using **UDP hole punching** to establish a direct connection with the other peer.
4. Exchanging chat messages over that UDP connection.
